    <p>
        The world was now experiencing global food shortages and power failures. People were starving and there
        was not enough people to sustain working economies. The 'corrupt world' used this as an advantage, they staged
        mass propaganda to create the illusion that all of these faults had happened as a result of the Cryptonians and
        not as a result of what they had exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The starving people believed it, life hadn't been this way before Cryptonia had been around and it was a direct
        correlation that there suffering began at the same time of the birth of Cryptonia. The people joined forces, countries
        that had originally allied with the Cryptonians, had now sided with corruption once again. The Cryptonians had avoided
        war at all costs but it was now inevitable, as it was coming straight at them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Cryptonian people also began to question their leadership, they had been made feel as if they were all responsible for
        the death and starvation of millions across the planet. The people had seemingly forgotten about all of the peace treaties
        that Cryptonia had offered, all of the other peaceful alternatives and wealth redistribution methods that had been suggested.
        The Cryptonians even tried to send food to all of the suffering countries but all shipments were intervened by authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
        The war came quick and suffered countless casualties, the Cryptonians now had to defend themselves from every country combined.
        Although they had more technology and the ability to single handedly defeat the enemies, the Cryptonian population turned against
        its leaders in fear that they were all going to die due to the sheer amount of countries outnumbering them. The leaders were forced
        to surrender and the corrupted world did everything in its power to suppress the memories of Cryptonia, until the next time the forgotten
        twelve are remembered. The corrupt governments spent many years regaining order and restoring 'normality' to civilisation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world would once again succumb to the chains that had held it down for eternity.
