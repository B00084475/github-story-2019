        The sound of alarm sirens ring throughout the air to warn of the incoming attacks, this had become a daily
        occurrence in the city of Cryptonia. A horrible war had ensued throughout the winter and the Cyrptionians were
        on the brink of victory but this was no oridinary war. This war was a ruthless economic battle against the banks,
        in an attempt to create a fair econmic system.

        However, it had not always been this way. For the past 100 years, the city of Cryptonia had been busy creating
        the closest thing to a Eutopia the world had ever seen. The city was founded in secret, by what is now known as
        'the forgotten twelve'. These men and women sacrificed their lives in an attempt to abolish the corrupted
        banking systems in place all over the world.

        The forgotten twelve were a group that included some of the worlds leading scientists and powerful figures.
        Together with their knowledge and power, they attempted to overthrow the world banking and political systems.
        They manage to successfully create a program that removed every single data entry into any banking system,
        meaning all account information vanished overnight and the banks no longer had any control over their systems,
        this created overnight chaos that rippled around the planet.

    <p>
        The forgotten twelve were apprehended before they could take responsibility for the attack and carry out the rest of their plans.
        The bug's responsibility was blamed on an error relating to the end of the banks fiscal year. This widely became known as 'The Spring Bug' as this was the time of year the banks completed their end of year reports.
        With the forgotten twelve seemingly non existent, it seemed as if their attempts were just a made up story for conspiracy enthusiasts.

        Exactly three years later, a video forcefully appeared on every smart device in existence.
        This video was unstoppable and appeared on any device connected to a network that had the capability to display an image, sound or video.
        The video was created by the forgotten twelve, they had anticipated there end and ensured the truth would be known and there work would not be forgotten.
        The interactive video highlighted every corruption within the banking and political system in a manner everyone could understand alongside all the facts
        which prove these allegations. They had spent years gathering this research and had to ensure it would be seen. Now every person on the planet knew the truth
        about how the banking and financial systems were being manipulated to ensure that the wealthy could control virtually anything, from the movement of stock markets, to the mouths of politicians.    </p>
