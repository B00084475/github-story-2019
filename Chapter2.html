        The video had a massive effect all over the world, bigger than any radical change seen before.
        Not only were the people now informed to the level of corruption they ensued, they where also given a choice to fight back.
        The video invited every human being alive to join the resistance and come to Cryptonia. The only requirement was for the person to have a genuine
        wanting for a better society and be ready to renounce their birth certificate.

        Cryptonia was situtated within the United Arab Emirates. The President of the United Arab Emirates, Mozir Bin Khalid was a member of the forgotten twelve.
        As the majority of the members were American, they were unable to build anything remotley big enough on their own soil without being noticed. The 'Cryptonia' project was
        fronted as 'eco-domes', which would enable UAE to build cities within domes which could sustain a particular climate. A location was chosen where four major cities would
        be built, another member of the twelve, Edward Larson was the owner of a international construction corportaion 'Larson Industries' and was hired to build the eco-domes. While
        the cities were being built, a city bigger than any other was built underground connecting all four cities. All of the above ground projects were made public and as the
        domes had been talked about for a long time, nobody suspected anything out of the oridinary.
